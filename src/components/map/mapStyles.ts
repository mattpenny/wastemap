 *   • official  → **Lands Department, HKSAR Government** official map, served
 *                 from the HK GeoData Store MapAPI as two raster tile layers:
 *                 the cartographic basemap plus a separate label layer that is
 *                 published in BOTH English and Traditional Chinese. The label
 *                 source is swapped to match the app's language, so the map
 *                 legend and the map labels stay in the same language.
 *   • satellite → Esri World Imagery plus the Esri boundaries/places overlay.
 *
 * Both are key-less public endpoints, so the app runs with no API token.
 *
 * On "3D": the MapAPI publishes raster basemap + label tiles only — there is no
 * 3D-tile or vector endpoint (verified: /xyz/3d, /xyz/basemap3d, /xyz/building
 * and /xyz/vector all 404). The three-dimensional presentation therefore comes
 * from this app: a pitched MapLibre camera plus deck.gl extruded pillars drawn
 * over the official map. Lands Department publishes true 3D building geometry
 * separately as Open3Dhk / 3D-BIT00 if that is ever wanted.
 *
 * Attribution for the official map is mandatory under the Lands Department
 * terms of use, so it is baked into the style.
